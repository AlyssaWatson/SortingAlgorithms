# SortingAlgorithms
Code for many different sorting algoriths in Python

Sorting numbers can be especially important in may applications. It can be a precursor to processing data and many other applications. So it is important to know how to sort numbers efficiently. Here I have code for many sorting algorithms along with their run time on a list of 100 random integers repeated 10,000 times. This will help compare sorting algorithms. I will add more sorting algorithms when I have time. There is also a time for comparison of Python's built in sorted() function for comparison. For most cases the built-in function is the fastest implementation.
